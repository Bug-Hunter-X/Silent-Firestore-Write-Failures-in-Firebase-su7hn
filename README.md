# Silent Firestore Write Failures in Firebase

This repository demonstrates a bug where Firestore writes fail silently without error messages in the Firebase JavaScript SDK.  The `firestoreBug.js` file contains the code exhibiting the problem, and `firestoreBugSolution.js` offers a potential solution involving robust error handling and transaction management.

## Bug Description
Inconsistent write behavior to Firestore. Writes sometimes succeed, but others fail without any error callbacks or console messages. This makes debugging and ensuring data integrity extremely difficult.

## Solution
The suggested solution utilizes explicit error handling within `.catch()` blocks and the use of Firestore transactions to ensure atomicity of write operations. This improves reliability by providing feedback in case of errors and prevents partial writes.
